Q1 https://leetcode.com/problems/car-fleet/
    cars = sorted(zip(position, speed), reverse=True)
    times = [float(target - pos) / spd for pos, spd in cars]

    fleets = 0
    while len(times) > 1:
        lead_time = times.pop(0)
        follow_time = times[0]

        if lead_time < follow_time:
            fleets += 1
            times[0] = lead_time

    return fleets + bool(times)
